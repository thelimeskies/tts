Introduction 
One of the most dangerous malignant diseases to
people's lives and health is cancer (Hong et al., 2020). Cancer is a
hereditary disease with a complex multi-step process that causes healthy cells
to change how they regulate several signaling pathways involved in cell
proliferation, angiogenesis, metastasis, and resistance to apoptosis. (Naro et al., 2022).
The hallmark of cancer is initiated by the accumulation of genetic defects that
could alter gene expression patterns, causing a complete imbalance of the
cellular activity and microenvironment (Hong et al., 2020). 
Human cancer was identified
as a genetic illness in the late 1990s. Since then, enormous efforts have been
undertaken in the field of genomics to identify the genetic changes associated with
tumour formation. Since scientists have known for decades that genes and genetic
changes are the basis for cancer initiation and progression. Genomics is an important
field that is essential for understanding, earlier diagnosis and treating
cancer (Michael et al., 2019). For instance, it has been shown that
mutations in the tumour-suppressor genes BReast CAncer gene 1 (BRCA1) and BReast CAncer gene 2 (BRCA2)
are risk factors for developing breast, prostate and ovarian cancer (Fu et al., 2022). The difficulties of treating advanced-stage
and/or chemoresistant cancer patients have made the battle to eliminate the
disease more fierce. [Nevertheless, recent advancements in genomics have sparked the
creation of specific treatments and procedures for early detection and
prevention, leading to significant reduction in advancements in the treatment
of cancer (Naro et al., 2022)]()[[OO1]](#_msocom_1)  
The
way we understand cancer is changing as a result of genomics. Contrary to more two
decades ago, before the human genome project, when the technologies, techniques
and expertise required for gene sequencing and genomic studies were rudimentary
and had low throughput. Rapid advances in genomic studies and their improved technology
have made it possible to analyze the molecular makeup of various cancer types
in detail within a short time. More effective chemotherapy with good precision,
high selectivity and excellent success rate can be developed based on the
genomic understanding of cancer onset and progression.[ ]()[[OO2]](#_msocom_2) The
ultimate objective is to provide every cancer patient with a therapeutic
regimen that is tailored to the individual  and the uniqueness of the disease in the best optimal
way (Bianca, 2020) 
Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS)  
Next-Generation Sequencing(NGS) has emerged as a salient method for getting an accurate and deeper
view of individual tumours' molecular signatures. With the new standard of care
for cancer being targeted therapies, using NGS has greatly increased cancer management
precision and efficiency. Compared to other traditional methods, NGS provides
more sensitivity, accuracy and high throughput because of its ability to
sequence multiple genes in just one assay. NGS has posed to be a more
economical and time-conserving approach to cancer research, paving the way to
precision medicine (Wu
et al., 2022). NGS has revealed the presence of age-related somatic mutations in the
human genome and has helped elucidate the background of different cancer
developments among different ethnicity, environments, and races (Naro
et al., 2020). 
Personalized/Precision
Medicine  
One of the
biggest impacts and gains of genomics on cancer treatment is the choice of
treatment. Information on the genetic
changes in a patient's tumour is used to determine the type of treatment to
receive; this is known as precision medicine or personalised care (Musyuni et al., 2022). As a result of research into the genomic changes
associated with cancer, chemotherapic drugs have been designed with more
precision and specificity to target cancer cells, leaving normal human cells
unharmed. This targeted therapy has been able to ameliorate the limitation of
chemotherapy or other treatment like radiation, which causes the death of
normal healthy cells in the cause of treatment. 
There are a good number
of precision medicine already in use; some examples are Trastuzumab (Herceptin),
Erlotinib(Tarceva), and Imatinib (Gleevec) (NIH, 2021). 
Trastuzumab is
a monoclonal antibody that targets the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2
(HER2), a protein that is overexpressed in some types of cancer cells,
including breast cancer. The mechanism of action of trastuzumab is thought to
involve several processes, including blocking the HER2 receptor from sending
growth-promoting signals, activating the immune system to attack HER2-positive
cancer cells, and promoting cancer cell death (Maadi et al., 2021). 
A study by
Bradley et al, examined the
effectiveness of trastuzumab in reducing the risk of breast cancer recurrence,
death from breast cancer, and all-cause mortality by analyzing the outcomes of
seven randomized trials involving 13,864 patients enrolled for 5 years. The
results showed that trastuzumab combined with chemotherapy significantly
reduced the risk of breast cancer recurrence and death from breast cancer
compared to chemotherapy alone. The 10-year recurrence risk was reduced by 9%
and 10-year breast cancer mortality was reduced by 6.4%, with no increase in
death without recurrence (Bradley et al., 2021). 
Erlotinib
(brand name Tarceva) on the other hand, is a small molecule inhibitor of the
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which is a protein that is often
overexpressed in cancer cells. Erlotinib works by binding to the EGFR protein
and blocking the signals that promote cell growth and division, leading to
cancer cell death. Erlotinib has been studied in several clinical trials for
the treatment of various types of cancer, including non-small cell lung cancer,
pancreatic cancer, and others. In clinical trials, erlotinib has been shown to
improve progression-free survival and overall survival in some patients (Dong et al., 2021). 
In one study of
patients with non-small cell lung cancer, erlotinib was compared to
chemotherapy as a second-line treatment. The study found that erlotinib
improved progression-free survival by 2.2 months compared to chemotherapy. In
another study of patients with pancreatic cancer, erlotinib was combined with
gemcitabine, and the combination therapy improved overall survival by about two
weeks compared to gemcitabine alone.(Assenat et al., 2021).
